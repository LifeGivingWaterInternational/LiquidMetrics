# LGWI Liquid Metrics
This is the senior design project of Ben Tanis and Jacob Westra, both class of '24 seniors at Calvin University.

This was comissioned Life Giving Water International (LGWI), to monitor well water for LGWI's water systems in Ecuador. You can read more [here](https://jacobwestra.com/LGWI/).

## Picking up development
If you're reading this, chances are you're the '25 students who picked this project (or were assigned it by Kvlinden). Here are some notes!
* Everything contained in `/old` is (mostly) outdated, and only exists for archival purposes. This includes our react-native client â€“ which I (Jacob) am officially retiring. Here are some reasons why:
  - It's dependency hell. Getting a development environment set up is an absolute nightmare, requiring you to install old/outdated versions of packages
  - There were a lot of iOS- or Android-specific bugs.
